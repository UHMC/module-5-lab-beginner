# Module 5 - Beginner Lab: Cryptography

## Background
Cryptography is the backbone of essentially all online financial systems; however, as you may have inferred from the term, cryptocurrencies are unequivocally dependent upon cryptography to function. In this lab, we will go through a basic cryptography exercise which introduces one of the better-known cryptographic tools available to the public: GPG, or Gnu Privacy Guard. As an aside, you may find the history of GPG quite interesting, as due to legal issues, it came to be offered as source code printed in a physical book which programmers could then write for themselves and compile into a working copy.
